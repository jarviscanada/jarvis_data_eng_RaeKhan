# Rae Khan . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Rae Khan, I have recently joined Jarvis as a Data Engineer and would like to introduce myself. I have earned a Bachelors of Aerospace Engineering from Ryerson University. Throughout my academic career, I became proficient at MATLAB coding and within the last several years, I have honed my software skills. I have completed courses on platforms such as Udemy and edX in topics such as VBA programming and SQL. In my previous position, I worked as a Python Instructor. I taught various students the basics of Python, such as syntax, data types, and functions. Additionally, I recently completed a Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs gaining additional software skills such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I look forward to expanding my software skillset with Jarvis.
