# Rae Khan . Jarvis Consulting

I have earned a Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering from Ryerson University. Throughout my academic career, I became proficient at MATLAB by continually programming for various school projects and assignments. Within the last several years, I have further honed my software skills by learning VBA and SQL. In addition, I have worked as a Full Stack Developer on various web applications, gaining additional skills in JavaScript React, HTML, and CSS. Previously, I worked as a Lead Robotics Instructor where I taught various students the basics of Lego Robotics, Python, and Scratch Programming. I was responsible for developing and distributing lesson plans, delegating tasks, and troubleshooting various issues. Moreover, I see myself as a mold for complex problems, I love working with large amounts of data, and challenging myself to find solutions. Software is an outlet for me to engage with these problems, employ creative results, and I am excited for upcoming opportunities to expand my software skills.
